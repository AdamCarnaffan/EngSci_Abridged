# Engineering Science, Abridged

During my time at the University of Toronto's Engineering Science program, I create(d) polished 'textbooks' as review notes for many of my courses. I attempt to explain the concepts as simply as possible so that I (and perhaps others) can rapidly learn and utilize this content when they need to.

This repository is supercedes previous term-specific repositories (e.g. `EngSci_2.2_Abridged`). Content includes classes from the Machine Intelligence option of the program.

As of October 2020, over 293 pages have been written.

## How to Use This Repository

See the `pdf` folder for PDF's from all of the classes for which I created notes for. Raw LaTeX files can be found in `tex`.
