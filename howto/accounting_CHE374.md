# Accounting: How-To


## Notes from Examples

- Rent is is decremented from cash and incremented in *pre-paid expenses*. 
	- 'Rent used up' means that you decrement pre-paid expensese and increment COGS or *SG&A*.
- If something is "purchased on credit", you increment *accounts payable*. 
- Utilities generally go under SG&A, also increment accounts payable. 
- "Bills paid" means paying off *accounts payable*.

## Organization of T-Tables

### Left Side: Assets + Expenses

Assets: 
- Cash
- Accounts Receivable
- Inventories
- Pre-Paid Expenses
- Equipment
- Office Supplies
- ...

Expenses
- COGS: Cost of Goods Sold. Expenses associated with manufacturing. 
	- If an item is 'consumed' from inventory "for sales", it increments here (after decrementing from inventories or other). 
- SG&A: Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Costs of doing business not directly associated with manufacturing goods. 
- *Depreciation*


### Right Side: Liabilities + Equity + Revenue

Liabilities
- Accounts Payable: Expenses not yet paid out for. 
- Accrued Liabilities: ???
- Notes Payable: Money owed to shareholders. 
- Long-Term Liabilities: >1 year loans, mortgages, bonds, etc. 

Equity
- Paid in Capital: Money invested by investors.
- Retained Earnings: Exactly what it soundslike.

Revenue
- Revenue: Literally just any money made from customers. 
	- You still count it if it hasn't been received yet.
